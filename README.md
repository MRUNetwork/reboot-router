As TP-LINK doesn't provide any standard API for communicating with low-end router models, this app is just a **shortcut** to reboot functionality of the router's web client.
If your router has [this](https://github.com/ni554n/reboot-router/raw/master/art/screen_router_web_client.png) UI, it should probably work.
I also wrote a **Python 3** script that has somewhat equivalent functionality. Check this [gist](https://gist.github.com/ni554n/fdbab004af3b5c6b28b961af96347250) if you are interested.
